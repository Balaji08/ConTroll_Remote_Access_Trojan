## INSTRUCTION
Students are required to work in groups of four (4) to complete any one of the questions below. To choose a question, submit a request to your tutor via email. 

## SUBMISSION
Students are to submit source code of the assignment to their respective lab tutors by the deadline specified. Non submission of the assessment by the due date is an automatic zero. Electronic confirmation of assignment receipt is required by the due date by your instructor. Each group will get up to 15 minutes to make a presentation and demonstrate their implementations in their lab time after the due date. All code for the assignment should be written by you. You can write your application(s) in any language of your choice. 

### Password Sniffer and Cracker 
Create an application that will extract packet daat from an analyzer software (Eg. Wireshark) based on certain criteria (Eg. Identifying the fact that the name of the page transmitting data is named Login page. This would indicate that maybe some type of credentials are going to be transmitted)and actively attempt to crack any hashed credentials that are being sent across the network and captured by said analyzer. Note, you will need to use an existing application or create another application that transmits data (Eg. Credentials) across a client server network using a hash algorithm of your choice (Preferably a weak enough one so that it can be cracked). 

### Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
Create a remote access trojan that will establish administrative control over any machine it compromises. The RAT should be able to accomplish the following: 1) Monitoring user behavior through keylogger capabilities (Keystrokes and Screenshots) 2) Activate a system’s webcam and record video. Note: You must also demonstrate the method that will be used to compromise the user’s machine (Eg. Email or game)
